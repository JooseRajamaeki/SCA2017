There are a few typos in the paper:
Equation (1): \Sigma_2^2 should be just \Sigma_2
Equation (2) should be \Sigma^{-1} = \Sigma_1^{-1} + \Sigma_2^{-1}

" In all the simulations of the supplemental video, the threshold is set to double the the cost of the previous iteration’s best trajectory."
Should be:
" In all the simulations of the supplemental video, the threshold is set to double the the cost of the previous iteration’s best trajectory's last transition's cost."
